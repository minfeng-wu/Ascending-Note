Hibernate II:

Design Pattern - Factory
Generate your class objects in a centralized location
Creats objects without explose the instantiation logic to the client

Benefit:
Hide the detail of creation of class objects
centralized control the generated objects to ensure a consistent behavior within the application, 直接get东西，不管constructor有没有改
loose coupling between class
